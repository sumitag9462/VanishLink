## Technical Highlights

### Smart Auto-Escalation
Links flagged for malware, phishing, or illegal content automatically get HIGH priority status, ensuring critical threats are reviewed first.

### Comprehensive Bulk Actions
Admins can select multiple reports and:
- Approve all (mark as reviewed)
- Block all associated links
- Delete all associated links
- Reject all reports

Each bulk action creates a single audit log with success/failure metrics.

### Real-Time Statistics
Dashboard displays live counts of:
- Total reports in system
- Reports awaiting review
- Reports currently under review
- High-priority reports needing immediate attention

### Flexible Reporting
- Users can report anonymously
- Authenticated users have their email logged
- Reports track IP and user agent for abuse prevention
- Optional reporter email allows follow-up communication

### Keyword Intelligence
System automatically:
- Checks both URL and title for banned terms
- Case-insensitive matching
- Creates detailed audit trail
- Blocks link immediately (configurable)
- Generates system report for admin review

## Usage Guide
